Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Java allows you to create multiple constructors for a class. This is called constructor overloading. Constructor overloading allows you to create different constructors for a class, each with a different set of parameters. This can be useful when you need to create objects in different ways.

- Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
Java is a "pass-by-value" programming language. When you pass a variable as an argument to a method, you are passing a copy of the value of that variable, not the variable itself. This means that changes made to the parameter within the method do not affect the original variable outside the method.
