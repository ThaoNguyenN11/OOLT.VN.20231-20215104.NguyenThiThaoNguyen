Reading Assignment: 
- What are the advantages of Polymorphism?
Helps programmers reuse the code and classes once written, tested and implemented.
Single variable name can be used to store variables of multiple data types.
Reducing the coupling between different functionalities

- How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
Inherit methods from their parent classes, and override those methods to provide their own specific implementations.

- What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java?
Polymorphism allows the programmer to write multiple definitions of a function. At the same time, inheritance enables the user to reuse the already written code.

Question: Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using the Comparator class I have mentioned, you can use the Comparable interface1 and override the compareTo()method. You can refer to the Java docs to see the information of this interface.
Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.
- What class should implement the Comparable interface?
Class media to establish a natural ordering for general media items.

- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method to reflect the ordering that we want?
Use compareTo() methods of relevant attributes for comparisons. Chain comparisons for multiple attributes based on desired priority.

- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
The Comparable interface enforces a single natural ordering.

- Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
It would introduce a length field for all media types, even those that don't require it.
