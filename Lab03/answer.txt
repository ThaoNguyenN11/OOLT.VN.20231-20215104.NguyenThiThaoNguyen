Reading Assignment: 
- What are the advantages of Polymorphism?
Helps programmers reuse the code and classes once written, tested and implemented.
Single variable name can be used to store variables of multiple data types.
Reducing the coupling between different functionalities

- How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
Inherit methods from their parent classes, and override those methods to provide their own specific implementations.

- What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java?
Polymorphism allows the programmer to write multiple definitions of a function. At the same time, inheritance enables the user to reuse the already written code.

Question:
- What class should implement the Comparable interface? 
- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method to reflect the ordering that
we want?
- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this
Comparable interface approach?
- Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then
decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
